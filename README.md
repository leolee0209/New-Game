This program is a simple 2D simulation game where users can place "components" and "entities" on a grid-based map, and then simulate their interactions.\
Basically, you put a lot of "components" on the map and press Enter, then all of them starts behaving in a consistent and simple way.\
The fun part is how the components are so simple that they can't really do much, but once they are pieced together in a well thought out way, they can do amazing things, and sky is the limit.\
The goal is to create complex behaviors and systems by combining these basic elements.
