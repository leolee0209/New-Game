It's a very nice thing that I would describe as a building of a machine or sorts./
Basically, you put a lot of "components" on the map and press Enter, then all of them starts behaving in a consistent and simple way./
The fun part is how the components are so simple that they can't really do much, but once they are pieced together in a well thought out way, they can do amazing things, and sky is the limit./
